Church of Santa Maria

The Church of Santa Maria is located on the southeast side of Infante D. Henrique Square, in the city center, also bordering Rua do Castelo dos Governadores and Jardim da Constituição. On the ground floor is the main entrance portal, flanked by medallions of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and fluted columns, with two windows, one on each side of the portal. On the upper floor, there is a large window above the door, topped by a niche. The balconies and window frames stand out for their elaborate stonework and ironwork. There is also a side door providing access to the nave. The building is in the neoclassical style.

The structure has a symmetrical layout with a single rectangular nave, three side chapels, a sacristy located on the left side façade, a baptistery, an elevated main chapel, and a choir above the entrance area. Inside, the image of Our Lady of Piety stands out. The church also features two bell towers with belfries. One of the most notable elements is the pipe organ, considered a rare cultural asset in the Algarve region.

Next to the church is the former Customs Rowers' Barracks, built in the 17th century, and the old building of the Lagos Hospital.

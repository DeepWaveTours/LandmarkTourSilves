Praia da Batata is the most central beach in Lagos. It is located in front of the castle walls and next to the Fort of Ponta da Bandeira. The convenience of its location attracts tourists staying in nearby hotels and those who just want to catch a few hours of sun. Therefore, it becomes crowded in the summer, even at night, when young people from Lagos use it as a stage for music festivals or volleyball tournaments.

Although not certain, according to legend, Praia da Batata got its name when a shipwreck occurred nearby, and the potatoes it was carrying washed ashore here.

It is a small cove that is the first in a series of beaches nestled among golden rock formations. A tunnel provides access to the neighboring Praia dos Estudantes, which is frequently photographed for its iconic arch connecting two rock formations.

The sand is golden and fine, sometimes mixed with small shells and stones brought by the tides, causing some discomfort when walking along the shore. The sea is usually clear and calm, making it good for swimming. However, there are often more people in kayaks than swimming in the water, as this is the main starting point for coastal tours of Lagos. Another frequent activity is stand-up paddleboarding.

In the summer, there are lifeguards on duty and also some umbrellas and sun loungers for rent. Unlike neighboring beaches, this one has access for people with reduced mobility.

There is a bar for light meals and drinks at the entrance, a restaurant on top of the cliff, and many other options for eating and drinking within a short distance, as we are right in the city center.

Above the beach, there is a viewpoint with a panoramic view of the coast. Paved with Portuguese cobblestones, featuring the typical "mar largo" pattern, it also has a statue of São Gonçalo, the patron saint of Lagos and revered by Algarve fishermen.

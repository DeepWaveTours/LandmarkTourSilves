The Fort of Ponta da Bandeira, also known as Fort of Pau da Bandeira, Fort of Nossa Senhora da Penha de Fran√ßa, or Fort of the Registry, is a military monument in the city of Lagos, in the Algarve region of Portugal. It is situated at the entrance of the Lagos bar, in a location that was of great importance for the maritime defense of Lagos. It was built in the 17th century as one of the main components of a system of maritime fortifications to defend the city, then the headquarters of the military government of the Algarve. It suffered severe damage from the 1755 earthquake but was repaired shortly thereafter. It underwent restoration works in the 19th century, and in the 1950s and 1960s, it was profoundly modified by the Estado Novo regime, transforming it into a nautical center. It was transferred to the Lagos City Council in the 1970s, becoming a cultural venue. Inside, there is a small chapel dedicated to Saint Barbara, entirely lined with 17th-century tiles. It has been classified as a Property of Public Interest since 2002. It is considered one of the best-preserved 17th-century military structures in the Algarve.
